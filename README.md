# Choose Your Own Adventure — Web Interface

A web-based authoring tool and reader for branching CYOA stories. Built for *The Cave of Time* and extensible to any similarly structured story.

## Assignment Submission Info

- **Due:** 4/14/26 11:59pm
- **GitHub Repository URL:** https://github.com/Yhtomitos/choose-your-own-adventure
- **Deployed Website URL:** https://cyoa-21324.netlify.app/reader
- **Team Members:** Timothy So, Vincent Huang, Shreyas Sundar Ganesh

## Class Workflow Checklist

Use this checklist to match the required class process:

- Form your team and add yourself to the CYOA groups in Canvas (`People` section).
- Use the repository `https://github.com/pisan382/choose-your-own-adventure` and add all team members as contributors.
- Read `Fork-Instructions.md` to understand project goals and constraints.
- Read `AI-Instructions.md` to review the initial AI direction and constraints.
- Read `Codebase.md` before implementation and when prompting AI, so AI has current architecture context.
- Keep brainstorming in `Brainstorm.md`.
- Keep implementation tasks in `ToDo.md`.
- Coordinate team decisions early (feature scope, UI direction, ownership, review flow).
- Ask exploratory AI questions first and use planning mode before implementation.
- Keep `Codebase.md` updated as the architecture changes.
- Extend and deploy the project on a public website.
- Verify all team members committed to `main` via the commits page:
  `https://github.com/pisan382/choose-your-own-adventure/commits/main/`

## AI Collaboration Method

- Start by writing prompt drafts in project files, then copy/paste them into AI.
- This keeps a clear creation trace and supports reflection on early ideas.
- Full interaction history is encouraged but not required; following the method consistently is the priority.

## What You Get

- **Reader Mode** — Read the story page by page with clickable choices.
- **Graph Authoring Tool** — Visualize and edit the story graph using Cytoscape.js.
- **Path Explorer** — Browse every possible story path from start to finish.
- **Static Export** — Generate a zip of plain HTML pages that require no server.
- **MMD-First Architecture** — `cot-story-graph.mmd` is the canonical source of truth for all links.

## Quick Start (Development)

### 1. Install Dependencies

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
pip install pytest httpx playwright pytest-playwright
python3 -m playwright install chromium
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
pip install pytest httpx playwright pytest-playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
```

> **Note:** On Windows you may need to run PowerShell as Administrator or run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` first to allow script execution.

### 2. Run the Development Server

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn web.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn web.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

Then open:
- **Reader:** `http://localhost:8000/reader.html`
- **Graph Editor:** `http://localhost:8000/graph.html`
- **Path Explorer:** `http://localhost:8000/paths.html`

## How It Works

### MMD Is Canonical

The file `output/cot-story-graph.mmd` is the **only** source of truth for which pages link to which. When you edit text, the parser shows suggestions, but **you must explicitly approve** new edges before the MMD is updated.

### Reading a Story

1. Open `reader.html#2` to start at page 2.
2. Click choice links to navigate.
3. Use `1`, `2`, `3` keyboard shortcuts to pick the first, second, or third choice.
4. Terminal pages show a styled "The End" overlay.

### Editing the Graph

1. Open `graph.html`.
2. Click a node to see its text, MMD edges, and parser suggestions.
3. Click **Add Edge** (or shift-click another node) to connect pages.
4. Click **Remove** on an existing edge to delete it.
5. Drag nodes and click **Save Positions** to persist the layout.
6. Click **Rebuild from Text** to preview replacing the graph with parser output.

### Importing New Pages

Drag `.txt` files directly onto the graph canvas. The system uploads them and shows a diff report. You can add edges one by one or confirm a full rebuild.

### Exporting

Click **Export** in the graph toolbar (or `POST /api/export`). This:
- Regenerates `cot-story-graph.svg`
- Regenerates all story paths in `cot-stories/`
- Pre-renders a static site in `output/dist/`
- Creates `output/cyoa-export.zip`

## Running Tests

All tests run in isolated temp directories and do not mutate your real `output/` folder.

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Current status:** 45 tests passing (backend unit, frontend Playwright, integration, deployment, UI navigation).

## Deployment

### Option A: Full Stack (Authoring + Reader)

Run uvicorn behind a reverse proxy (Caddy or nginx).

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
# Terminal 1: start the app
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn web.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Terminal 2: start Caddy
caddy run --config Caddyfile.sample
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
# Terminal 1: start the app
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn web.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Terminal 2: start Caddy (if installed)
caddy run --config Caddyfile.sample
```

See `Caddyfile.sample` for a working reverse-proxy setup.

### Option B: Static Hosting (Reader Only)

After running export:

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
cd output/dist
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
cd output\dist
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`. No Python backend is required.

## Regenerating Canonical Assets

If you modify the raw page text files, you can regenerate the downstream artifacts:

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
# Rebuild MMD from text (optional; MMD is normally edited via the graph UI)
python3 scripts/build_story_graph.py \
  --pages-dir output/cot-pages-ocr-v2 \
  --output output/cot-story-graph.mmd

# Render SVG
python3 scripts/render_story_graph_svg.py \
  --graph output/cot-story-graph.mmd \
  --output output/cot-story-graph.svg

# Write all bounded stories
python3 scripts/write_all_stories.py \
  --graph output/cot-story-graph.mmd \
  --pages-dir output/cot-pages-ocr-v2 \
  --start-page 2 \
  --max-decisions 20 \
  --output-dir output/cot-stories
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
# Rebuild MMD from text (optional; MMD is normally edited via the graph UI)
python scripts\build_story_graph.py `
  --pages-dir output\cot-pages-ocr-v2 `
  --output output\cot-story-graph.mmd

# Render SVG
python scripts\render_story_graph_svg.py `
  --graph output\cot-story-graph.mmd `
  --output output\cot-story-graph.svg

# Write all bounded stories
python scripts\write_all_stories.py `
  --graph output\cot-story-graph.mmd `
  --pages-dir output\cot-pages-ocr-v2 `
  --start-page 2 `
  --max-decisions 20 `
  --output-dir output\cot-stories
```

## Notes

- Page numbers are derived from filenames (`02-CoT.txt` → page `2`).
- The parser handles OCR artifacts such as `tum` → `turn` and normalizes corrupted digits (`O` → `0`, `l` → `1`, etc.).
- Terminal detection recognizes `The End`, `End Story`, `Story Ends`, and `THE END`.
